    "* **Modify notch setup on CFG to cut red arm.** Notch with 2 fibers away from FP reduces intensity to almost 0, with a width of $\\approx 1nm$ in spectrum. Only $\\approx 2.5\\%$ of centrifuge power is lost. Hence, we can stop CFG without worrying about reduced power, which is the case with truncating."
